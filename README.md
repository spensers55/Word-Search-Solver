# Word-Search-Solver
My friends like to send me joke word searches so I made this to solve them.

To use in it's current form take a screenshot or picture of the word search in question and parse the image to text. My preferred parser is this: https://www.imagetotext.info
Highlight and copy the text from the parser and paste it into the wordSearch.txt file, replacing whatever's in there.
Run the application in Visual Studio.
Follow the instructions in the console (enter the word in all caps).
Done!
